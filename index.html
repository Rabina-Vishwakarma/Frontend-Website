            <h4>Sneha Dubey's first speech in the Assembly made a mark as she highlighted the history of the Thakurs...
              Honorable Speaker, and respected Governor, the vision you have provided for the overall development of the state will lead it towards a new path of progress.</h4>
            <p>The assurance given by the state government reflects a vision for the overall development of the state. In his speech, the respected Governor introduced a framework that will guide the state towards a new direction of progress. The schemes provided in the state include several unprecedented initiatives such as the "Purva Shlok Ahilya Devi Women’s Navoday Scheme," "Chief Minister My Beloved Sister Scheme," and "Chief Minister Annapurna Scheme," which have been announced by the government for the economic empowerment of women.... </p>
            <div class="hidden-content-article">
                <p>As a woman, I am immensely proud of this scheme. Our Maharashtra has become the first and only state in the country to honor motherhood. The state has decided to make it mandatory to include the mother's name in the name of every child born before May 1, 2024, and this decision will serve as a guiding light for the nation. This decision is a significant step towards establishing economic empowerment, social empowerment, and economic equality.

                  The government's decision has fulfilled the dreams of activists who have been fighting for Moulis for many years in various ways. It is expected that the government will take the right decision regarding the inclusion of the mother’s name in the names of children born before May 1, 2024.
                  
                  Honorable Speaker, respected Governor, in his speech, mentioned the Mumbai-Pune Metro project. This metro will make commuting easier, save time, and give Maharashtra momentum in terms of development.
                  
                  Honorable Speaker, I request that in the Vasai-Virar-Nalasopara area, where the population has increased significantly over the past many years, millions of people travel by local trains to Mumbai for work. To reduce the difficulties of this commute and for convenience, I urge that the local metro, which has reached Bhayandar, be extended to Vasai-Virar at the earliest.
                  
                  Under the state’s "Jal Jeevan Mission," the "Har Ghar Nal Yojana" is being implemented very effectively. This scheme aims to provide water through taps to every household without discrimination. Honorable Speaker, the rural areas in the Vasai constituency have been struggling for water for the last 35 years. I request that this scheme be implemented swiftly and water be provided to every home.
                  
                  Additionally, the "Amrit Yojana 2.0" has been started for urban areas. Even in municipal areas such as slums, chawls, and tribal areas, water is yet to reach. Keeping this in mind, I urge the government to take immediate action.
                  
                  Respected Governor, in his speech, announced the "Green Maharashtra Program," which will focus on increasing the green belt in Maharashtra. Vasai also has a beautiful green belt, which has been preserved through years of activism by my father, former MLA Vivek Pandit, and the people of Vasai. I request the government to focus on this.
                  
                  This government belongs to the common people, and I thank the government for all these initiatives. After 35 years, my constituency has blossomed with the lotus, emerging from the shadow of goondaism and terror, and this has been possible thanks to the efforts of Honorable Devendra Fadnavis and Honorable Eknath Shinde. I express my heartfelt gratitude to them.</p>

            <h4>First of all, I greet everyone while speaking on the important issue of improving the transportation system in the rural areas of Maharashtra.</h4>
            <p>An extremely important scheme has been proposed to make transportation in the rural areas of Maharashtra more effective and accessible. Based on the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, it is essential to create a small bridge (Sakav) plan that connects each village to another. This will make communication between rural areas easier and strengthen the transportation system.

              Approximately 500 to 600 villages in Maharashtra require the construction of small bridges. The expected cost for building these bridges is around 50 lakh to 5 crore rupees. In this regard, it is necessary for the central government to prepare a comprehensive plan and propose financial assistance for the construction of these bridges. For this purpose, I am presenting it to the Union Minister of Roads, Transport, and Highways, Nitin Gadkari ji, requesting guidance for preparing a proposal in line with all necessary requirements.</p>
            <div class="hidden-content-article">
                <p>
                  In my view, the importance of this is not just for Maharashtra, but for all the rural areas of the country. Because, when transportation improves in rural areas, that becomes the path to development.

Furthermore, Maharashtra currently has about 3 lakh kilometers of roads. Due to the efforts of Gadkari ji, many state highways have been converted into national highways, which has reduced some of our responsibilities. However, for the construction of an additional 96,000 kilometers of roads in Maharashtra, approximately 2 lakh crore rupees are required. Raising such a massive amount is extremely challenging for the state budget. Therefore, additional financial assistance from the central government is essential, which will benefit not only Maharashtra but the entire country.

Therefore, I am confident that if the central government extends more cooperation to Maharashtra in this regard, there will be significant development not just in that region, but across the entire country.</p>
